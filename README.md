## Project Introduction

As someone (a frontend developer) who used to face `VSCode` every day, I now use `Cursor` instead. **GPT** was first launched in November 2022. Then the upgraded version ChatGPT-4 was released in March 2023. Generally, the closer the date, the stronger the model's capabilities.

Understanding `Timing`: In `Model Timing`, it refers to the time point of the large language model's release, or the moment of excitement. In gaming, there’s also the saying “catching the timing”; with an increasing number of models, version commands are becoming more complex. Based on this background, we are developing a website mainly to record the "moment of models" of large language models, primarily in the form of timestamps, showcasing how various companies update their large language models over time. We hope to "catch" the explosive moment of model releases. This will also help to understand the characteristics of each model better, enabling better application in actual work and life.

However, as the names of the models become more complex, we sometimes do not even know which model's version is stronger. This is the background of our website development.
