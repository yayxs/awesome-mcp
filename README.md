## Model Timing

Understanding `Timing`: In `Model Timing`, it refers to the release time of large language models, or the moment of excitement. In games, there is also a saying "catching the Timing," as models become more numerous and version commands more complex. Based on this background, we developed a website mainly to record the "model moments" of large language models, primarily in the form of a timeline, showcasing the updates from various companies regarding large language models as time progresses. We hope to "capture" the explosive moment of a model's release. This also helps in understanding the characteristics of each model, allowing for better application in work and life.
